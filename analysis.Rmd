# Overview

## Purpose:
Determine probabiligy of finding the number of targets we find in each genome using simple word searching with `grep` command. Genomes searched (coding only) with bash function and number of hits for each sequence and GC stats are imported here.

## Method Outline:
- Use `dbinom(x = hits, size = GenomeSize, prob = SequenceProbability)`
- Calculate `SequenceProbability` by proportion of each nucleotide.

For example, if:

Genome ==> 0.33 A, 0.24 T, 0.20 G, 0.23 C

Then for seq ATGT = (0.33)(0.24)(0.20)(0.24) = 0.0038016 => SequenceProbability

# Method

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(multtest)
```

Import the counts and genome stats file
```{r}
all_pangenomes <- read_csv("all_pangenomes_wGenomeStats_miRNA_hits.csv")
