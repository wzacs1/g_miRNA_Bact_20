Sneathia species also exhibit a significant correlation with sexually transmitted diseases and cervical cancer. Because Sneathia species are fastidious and rarely cultured successfully in vitro; and the genomes of members of the genus had until now not been characterized, very little is known about the physiology or the virulence of these organisms. In this project, we describe a novel species, Sneathia amnii sp. nov, which closely resembles bacteria previously designated “Leptotrichia amnionii”. As part of the Vaginal Human Microbiome Project at VCU, a vaginal isolate of S. amnii sp. nov. was identified, successfully cultured and bacteriologically cloned.

Using an abundance co-variance strategy, we group highly co-varying genes into MetaGenomic Species, which represent a wide range of biological entities: bacterial genomes, plasmids, genomic islands, clonal variation and bacteriophages. Applying this concept to a new 3.9 million microbial gene catalogue derived from 396 human stool samples we identified 7,381 such MetaGenomic Species. They range in size from 3 to 6,319 genes, with 741 MetaGenomic Species resembling bacterial genomes in number of genes contained. The Meta-Genomic Species displays remarkable consistency in taxonomy and GC content. 247 of the MetaGenomic Species assemblies even pass the HMP high quality draft genome criteria.

This database, which is still growing, comprises data collected from multiple collaborators. Diagnostic test manufacturers develop sequence-based tests to identify infectious agents and/or to detect resistance or virulence markers; will use this database to advance their development programs and to support the regulatory science review of such tests. This work will facilitate the development of these tests, which are aimed at improving patient outcomes. Continued success of the database and adoption by the community is contingent on populating and curating the database, which in turn will support development of guidance and standards for clinical use of this technology.

Pubmed ID: 24509479. Evasion of clinical interventions by Streptococcus pneumoniae occurs through selection of non-susceptible genomic variants. We report whole-genome sequencing of 3,085 pneumococcal carriage isolates from a 2.4-km(2) refugee camp. This sequencing provides unprecedented resolution of the process of recombination and its impact on population evolution. Genomic recombination hotspots show remarkable consistency between lineages, indicating common selective pressures acting at certain loci, particularly those associated with antibiotic resistance. Temporal changes in antibiotic consumption are reflected in changes in recombination trends, demonstrating rapid spread of resistance when selective pressure is high. The highest frequencies of receipt and donation of recombined DNA fragments were observed in non-encapsulated lineages, implying that this largely overlooked pneumococcal group, which is beyond the reach of current vaccines, may have a major role in genetic exchange and the adaptation of the species as a whole. These findings advance understanding of pneumococcal population dynamics and provide information for the design of future intervention strategies.

This approach also allows rapid insights into the biosynthetic potential of microorganisms isolated from unexploited habitats and ecosystems, which in many cases may prove difficult to culture and manipulate in the laboratory. Streptomyces leeuwenhoekii C34 was isolated from the hyper-arid high-altitude Atacama Desert in Chile and shown to produce novel polyketide antibiotics. Results Here we present the de novo sequencing of the S. leeuwenhoekii C34 linear chromosome (8 Mb) and two extrachromosomal replicons, the circular pSLE1 (86 kb) and the linear pSLE2 (132 kb), all in single contigs, obtained by combining Pacific Biosciences SMRT (PacBio) and Illumina MiSeq technologies. We identified the biosynthetic gene clusters for chaxamycin, chaxalactin, hygromycin A and desferrioxamine E, metabolites all previously shown to be produced by this strain (J Nat Prod, 2011, 74:1965) and an additional 31 putative gene clusters for specialised metabolites. As well as gene clusters for polyketides and non-ribosomal peptides, we also identified three gene clusters encoding novel lasso-peptides. Conclusions The S. leeuwenhoekii C34 genome contains 35 gene clusters apparently encoding the biosynthesis of specialised metabolites, most of them completely novel and uncharacterised. This project has served to evaluate the current state of NGS for efficient and effective genome mining of high GC actinomycetes. The PacBio technology now permits the assembly of actinomycetes replicons into single contigs with >99% accuracy. Assembled Illumina sequencing permitted not only the correction of the omissions found in GC homopolymers (exacerbated by the high GC content of actinomycetes DNA) but more importantly to obtain the terminus of the chromosome and a linear plasmid not assembled by PacBio. We propose an experimental pipeline that uses the Illumina assembled contigs, in addition to just the reads, to complement the current limitations of the PacBio sequencing technology and assembly software."		98.7	96.2	100			"Good"	"2016-01-17T16:03:54.081Z"	"2016-01-17T16:03:54.081Z"

Bacterial vaginosis (BV) affects up to 29% of women and is the leading cause of vaginal discharge. BV is associated with a shift in the vaginal microbiota from commensal Lactobacillus spp. to a diversity of fastidious anaerobic and facultative organisms. G. vaginalis was the first organism associated with BV and is thought to play an important role in disease pathogenesis. BV is treated with metronidazole but recurrent disease affects more than half of treated women within on year. One contributing factor to recurrent disease could be metronidazole resistance among BV-associated organisms such as G. vaginalis. To gain a greater understanding of the molecular mechanism of metronidazole resistance in this organism we sequenced a highly resistant (minimum inhibitory concentration >500 micrograms/ml) clinical isolate for comparative studies with previously sequenced metronidazole-susceptible isolates."

This database, which is still growing, comprises data collected from multiple collaborators. Diagnostic test manufacturers develop sequence-based tests to identify infectious agents and/or to detect resistance or virulence markers; will use this database to advance their development programs and to support the regulatory science review of such tests. This work will facilitate the development of these tests, which are aimed at improving patient outcomes. Continued success of the database and adoption by the community is contingent on populating and curating the database, which in turn will support development of guidance and standards for clinical use of this technology. Discussions held at a relating public workshop on advancing regulatory science for high throughput sequencing devices for microbial identification and detection of antimicrobial resistance markers were essential to establish the safety and effectiveness of these devices."

This database, which is still growing, comprises data collected from multiple collaborators. Diagnostic test manufacturers develop sequence-based tests to identify infectious agents and/or to detect resistance or virulence markers; will use this database to advance their development programs and to support the regulatory science review of such tests. This work will facilitate the development of these tests, which are aimed at improving patient outcomes. Continued success of the database and adoption by the community is contingent on populating and curating the database, which in turn will support development of guidance and standards for clinical use of this technology. Discussions held at a relating public workshop on advancing regulatory science for high throughput sequencing devices for microbial identification and detection of antimicrobial resistance markers were essential to establish the safety and effectiveness of these devices."

Much of the clinically relevant antibiotic resistance in these bacteria is driven by genes carried on mobile pieces of DNA called plasmids. A particularly significant resistance mechanism called the Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase (KPC) is capable of hydrolyzing all penicillins, cephalosporins and carbapenems leaving very few therapeutic options for patients infected with blaKPC positive Enterobacteriaeceae. Unfortunately, the tools that we use for tracking of hospital transmission of bacteria do not focus on plasmids but rather the genome of the bacterium which has acquired the plasmid. Our project is to explore the blaKPC plasmid transmission across species in a single institution in Virginia where KPC-producing Gammaproteobacteria are endemic over several years using whole genome sequencing to gain insights into plasmid transmission and evolution of genes of drug resistance."

Much of the clinically relevant antibiotic resistance in these bacteria is driven by genes carried on mobile pieces of DNA called plasmids. A particularly significant resistance mechanism called the Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase (KPC) is capable of hydrolyzing all penicillins, cephalosporins and carbapenems leaving very few therapeutic options for patients infected with blaKPC positive Enterobacteriaeceae. Unfortunately, the tools that we use for tracking of hospital transmission of bacteria do not focus on plasmids but rather the genome of the bacterium which has acquired the plasmid. Our project is to explore the blaKPC plasmid transmission across species in a single institution in Virginia where KPC-producing Gammaproteobacteria are endemic over several years using whole genome sequencing to gain insights into plasmid transmission and evolution of genes of drug resistance."

There are two biovariants of C. trachomatis: trachoma and lyphogranuloma venereum (LGV). Trachoma isolates are non-invasive, whereas the LGV strains are invasive causing a disseminating infection of the local draining lymph nodes. Genome analysis has shown that the ocular and the genital trachoma isolates are 99.6 % identical at the sequence level and only show small differences in overall gene content. However, differences in coding potential, and the loss of function through point mutation, have been used to subdivide the trachoma strains into those associated with ocular and genital infections. We have previously sequenced a two LGV isolates; a long-term laboratory passaged strain and the recent ‘epidemic’ clinical LGV isolate causing proctitis. From these strains it was evident that there were no whole gene differences and that the recent epidemic isolate was a classical LGV isolate and has been circulating in the human population for a long time: an old strain causing a new disease. We have now put together a global collection of LGV isolates and are a sequencing them to determine the global phylogeny of this pathogen.. This data is part of a pre-publication release.
