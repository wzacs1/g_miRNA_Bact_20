Although V. tubiashii has been known for years, the lack of complete genome sequence has slowed the pace of research on this pathogen. Some strains reported to be V. tubiashii, including the American Type Culture Collection [ATCC, Manassas, VA] strain 19105, and strain RE22 were previously misidentified as V. tubiashii and were actually V. coralliilyticus, which is also a shellfish pathogen.

In spite of the importance of the pathogen, whole genome sequence was not reported till date. Therefore, in the present study, genome sequence of P. cichorii JBC1 was revealed for the first time and its different groups of genes were annotated. The genome of JBC1 is 5,986,012 bp in size and with average GC ratio of 58.1%. It encodes for 5,174 coding sequences (CDS) and among them, 4,218 CDS (81.52%) were with known function, while with 956 CDS (18.47%) were with unknown function. In addition, it encodes for 19 rRNA and 65 tRNA also. The genes related to virulence, transport mechanism, phytotoxic compound, secondary metabolite products were analyzed and the genome was compared with eight other Pseudomonas species, to understand species level diversity. In spite of high percentages of similarity, significant diversity was found among the different Pseudomonas species at genome level. Especially, comparison of pathogenicity island region indicated more divergence, which gave clue for difference in host specificity and degree of virulence. In addition, the presence of genes to antibiotic resistance and tolerance to heavy metal tolerance, and incorporation of prophage genome was also analyzed. The genome sequence of JBC1 will be a reference sequence for other P. cichorii strains, and useful resource for further needful research for development of pathogen control measures.'"		98.3	96.3	98.7	2		"Good"	"2014-12-08T22:12:38.311Z"	"2015-03-16T03:17:09.594Z"

The main carbohydrate portion is attributed to the sulfated polysaccharide, ulvan, embedded in the algal cell wall. Ulvan composition and structure have been studied in depth for its varied polymeric properties and biological activities. This draft genome sequence of an ulvan degrading bacterium joins the recently published genome of N. ulvanivoran.

This strain was isolated in mice from an infected tick. The most significant difference between the genome of E. ruminantium and those of the other Rickettsiales is the presence of a large number of repetitive sequences. These repeats make up 8.5% of the genome and consist of simple sequence repeats (SSRs), large tandem repeats, and dispersed repeats. These repeats are associated with 29 of the 32 pseudogenes which appear to have occured primarily through duplication events. In addition, it is thought that the SSRs may play a role in regulation or phase variation. Between 10-15% of the genes in free-living bacteria are thought to have been acquired by horizontal gene transfer. Intracellular bacteria have limited exposure to other bacteria and therefore a smaller portion of their genome is from other organisms. It is estimated that only 3% of the genome of E. ruminantium has been obtained by gene transfer. The existence of a large number of repeat elements may be a alternative strategy for increasing genetic diversity and improve the evolutionary fitness of E. ruminantium."		99.9	99.3	100			"Good"	"2014-12-08T22:11:10.071Z"	"2015-03-16T03:17:09.594Z"

This project will support the systematic sequence-based studies and understanding of the biogeographical effects on species evolution as well as the mechanisms of symbiotic nitrogen fixation (SNF) by RNB. The latter is a significant asset for world agricultural productivity, farming economy and environmental sustainability. SNF reduces energy consumption required to produce nitrogenous fertilizer, saving $US 6.8 billion per year. SNF significantly reduces greenhouse gas emissions compared to intensive agriculture practice using artificial N-input. SNF benefits the environment (reduces dry-land salinity, increases soil fertility, and prevents waterway eutrophication). Root endosymbioses promote carbon sequestration. Shared genetic mechanisms between fungal and bacterial root endosymbioses exist and a detailed understanding of endosymbionts will be beneficial to drive bioenergy development from trees.

The main carbohydrate portion is attributed to the sulfated polysaccharide, ulvan, embedded in the algal cell wall. Ulvan composition and structure have been studied in depth for its varied polymeric properties and biological activities. This first draft genome sequence of an ulvan degrading bacterium provides a major step towards the unveiling of the enzymes that participate in Ulva degradation and Ulvales cell wall polysaccharide utilization.
